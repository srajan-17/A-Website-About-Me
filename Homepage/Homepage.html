				<p align="center"><font size="4"> My name is Siddharth Rajan. I am in high school, and I am going to college next year. I am 17 years old, and I go to
				NEST+M, which is in the Lower East Side part of Manhattan. When I go to college I want to pursue a career as a computer engineer, a person who can design both
				computer hardware and software. That is why I am taking computer science in my last year of high school. As you can see, this website wouldn't look like what it is
				without the help of the incredible CSS. As I was making every page of this website, I continued to learn more about CSS and what it can do. Now that this intro is over,
				click the links on the left to explore the rest of my digital portfolio. The following images are a small preview of what you will be seeing on this site. They will make 
				sense later. </font></p>
