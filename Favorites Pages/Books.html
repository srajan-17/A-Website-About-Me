				<p align="center"><font size="4"> When it comes to school, I read a countless amount of books, whether I want to or not. Outside school, 
				however, I don't really read much, as I am wearied out from reading school-related things. However, I still have some "favorite" books. 
				Some include the first two books of the Hunger Games series, <i> The Hunger Games </i> and <i> Catching Fire. </i> I haven't read 
				<i> Mockingjay </i> yet because don't have a lot of time. Other books include every book in the City of Ember series, <i> The City of Ember </i>
				<i> The People of Sparks, </i> <i> The Prophet of Yonwood, </i> and <i> The Diamond of Darkhold. </i> Other than these books, 
				I don't really have other favorites. Maybe if I had more time on my hands, I would be able to read a lot more books. </font></p>
