# Project: A Website About Me

# This is a project I made in high school. It is a website that serves as an autobiography of me. My primary purpose of making this project public is to demonstrate my abilities of understanding and working with markup languages. Download the source files and open the Homepage.html file to reach the starting point of the website.

# This project was written using HTML and CSS.
